# Dynamic Market Insights Tool (DMIT) & ForexFactory Web Scraper

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook for running two tools:

- **Dynamic Market Insights Tool (DMIT)**: A Streamlit app that visualizes stock market data and builds an LSTM model for price predictions.
- **ForexFactory Web Scraper**: A tool that scrapes forex calendar data and exports it to a CSV file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the tools on Google Colab:

### 1. Install Necessary Libraries

Run the following cell to install required libraries and `localtunnel`:
  
  ```python
    !pip install streamlit yfinance pandas requests numpy matplotlib pandas_datareader keras scikit-learn selenium
    !npm install -g localtunnel
  ```

### 2. Setup Streamlit App for DMIT

Create the `DMIT.py` file with the code for the Dynamic Market Insights Tool:

  ```python
    %%writefile DMIT.py
    # (Insert the DMIT.py code here from your provided script)
  ```

### 3. Setup ForexFactory Web Scraper

Create the `forexfactory.py` file for the ForexFactory web scraper:

  ```python
    %%writefile forexfactory.py
    # (Insert the forexfactory.py code here from your provided script)
  ```

### 4. Deploy Streamlit App

To deploy the Streamlit app and make it accessible:

1. **Fetch Your Public IP Address**:

   ```python
        !wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
   ```

2. **Run Streamlit App and Setup Localtunnel**:

   ```python
        !streamlit run DMIT.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
   ```

   - Copy the IPv4 address displayed from the previous command.
   - Use this IPv4 address as a password for the localtunnel URL.
   - Access the app using the URL generated by localtunnel in the output and paste the copied IPv4 address as the password to access the Streamlit application.

### 5. (Optional) Run ForexFactory Web Scraper

To scrape data from ForexFactory:

1. **Change to the Pages Directory**:

   ```python
        !mkdir -p /content/pages
        %cd /content/pages
   ```

2. **Run the ForexFactory Scraper**:

   ```python
        !python forexfactory.py
   ```

   - Download the generated CSV file and view the data.

## Code Explanation

### `DMIT.py`
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance based on user-selected tickers and date ranges.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays stock closing prices with moving averages and builds an LSTM model for price prediction.
- **Model Training**: Trains and saves the LSTM model to predict future prices.

### `forexfactory.py`
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium to scrape forex calendar data from ForexFactory.
- **Data Export**: Saves the scraped data to a CSV file and provides a download link.

## Troubleshooting

- **Localtunnel Issues**: Ensure that `localtunnel` is correctly installed and running. Check for any error messages and verify that the Streamlit app is running.
- **Library Errors**: Verify that all necessary libraries are installed correctly. Re-run the installation commands if necessary.
